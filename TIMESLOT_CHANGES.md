## 🔧 Technical Details

### Database Function Changes
The `get_companion_time_slots` function now generates slots from:
- Start: `08:00:00` (8:00 AM)
- End: `19:30:00` (7:30 PM - last 30-minute slot starts here)
- This allows bookings until 8:00 PM

### Time Slot Generation
- 30-minute intervals maintained
- Total slots per day: 24 (vs 16 previously)
- Booking validation ensures proper duration fitting

### Validation Logic
1. **Frontend Validation:**
   - Check if current time >= 5:00 PM
   - Validate booking duration (1-12 hours)
   - Validate time slots within business hours

2. **Backend Validation:**
   - Database function only returns valid time slots
   - Booking conflicts are checked against new time ranges

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Time slots display from 8 AM to 8 PM
- [ ] Maximum 12-hour bookings are allowed
- [ ] Booking cutoff works after 5 PM
- [ ] Admin panel reflects new time ranges
- [ ] Companion availability manager works with new hours
- [ ] All existing bookings still display correctly
- [ ] Time formatting is consistent across app

## 📝 Notes for Developers

1. **Time Utilities:** Always use functions from `src/lib/timeUtils.ts` for time-related operations
2. **Business Hours:** Reference `BUSINESS_HOURS` constants instead of hardcoding times
3. **Validation:** Use `isBookingCutoffReached()` for real-time booking validation
4. **Database:** The migration maintains backward compatibility with existing bookings

## 🐛 Potential Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Existing specific time slots outside new range
**Solution:** Existing specific slots outside 8 AM - 8 PM will still work, but new ones are validated against business hours.

### Issue: Users confused about cutoff time
**Solution:** Clear warning message displays after 5 PM with explanation.

### Issue: Companion availability conflicts
**Solution:** Availability manager validates all new slots against business hours.
